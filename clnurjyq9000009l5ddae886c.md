12. **Scenario**: You have a stateful application running on an EC2 instance, and you need to perform maintenance on the instance. How can you ensure minimal disruption to the application?
    
    <details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Stateful application</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">It refers to a type of software or service that relies on maintaining and managing the state or data specific to the application's operation. stateful applications may involve strategies like database replication, failover mechanisms, and backup and recovery procedures to ensure data integrity and minimal disruption in case of instance failures.</div></details>
    
    **Sample Answer**: To perform maintenance on a stateful application with minimal disruption:
    
    1. Implement a **load balancer** and distribute traffic across multiple instances.
        
    2. Create a maintenance window during low-traffic periods and use Amazon **Route 53** to perform DNS routing to a maintenance page or a backup instance.
        
    3. If possible, use **blue-green deployment** techniques to deploy changes to a new instance before switching traffic.
        
        <details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Blue-Green deployment</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">It is a deployment strategy used in software development and release management to minimize downtime and risks when updating or releasing a new version of an application or service. <strong>The "blue" environment</strong> represents the currently active and stable version of your application. This is the version that is currently serving production traffic and is considered the "<strong>live</strong>" environment. <strong>The "green" environment</strong> represents the new version of your application, which includes the changes or updates you want to deploy. This environment is separate from the blue environment and is not yet serving production traffic. By using this approach, you can perform updates or releases with <strong>minimal downtime and risk</strong>. If there are any issues with the green environment, you can quickly switch back to the blue environment to revert to the previous version. Blue-green deployments are often used in conjunction with load balancers or other traffic-routing mechanisms to facilitate this traffic-switching process seamlessly.</div></details>
        
13. **Scenario**: You have multiple EC2 instances in a VPC, and you need to securely communicate between them. How would you set up the network and security configurations?
