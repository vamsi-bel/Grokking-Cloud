Are you using AWS for your learning, projects or business but worry about unexpected costs? Setting up budget alarms in AWS can help you stay on top of your spending and prevent any surprises on your bill. In this beginner-friendly guide, we'll walk you through the steps to set up budget alarms for your AWS usage, ensuring you stay within your budget.

### **Why Set Up Budget Alarms?**

AWS offers a vast array of services and features, each with its own pricing structure. While this flexibility is fantastic, it can also lead to unintentional overspending if not managed carefully. Budget alarms provide proactive notifications when your spending approaches or exceeds predefined thresholds, allowing you to take action before costs spiral out of control.

### **Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console**

To get started, sign in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials. If you don't have an AWS account yet, you can create one for free.

### **Step 2: Navigate to the AWS Budgets Dashboard**

Once logged in, navigate to the AWS Budgets service by typing "Budgets" into the search bar at the top of the console. Click on the "Budgets" option that appears in the dropdown menu.

Or else, click on your account name or profile icon in the top right corner of the AWS Management Console. In the dropdown menu, select "Billing and Cost Management." This will take you to the Billing and Cost Management Dashboard.

From the left-hand navigation pane, click on "Budgets" under the "Budgets and Planning" section. This will direct you to the AWS Budgets dashboard.

### **Step 4: Configure Your Budget Details**

Next, you'll need to configure the details of your budget:

* **Budget Name**: Give your budget a descriptive name to help you identify it later. I'm giving "**My Monthly Cost Budget"**
    
* **Budget Period**: Choose the timeframe for your budget, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually. I'm choosing **"Monthly cost budget".**
    
* **Budgeted Amount**: Set the maximum amount you're willing to spend during the budget period. I don't want to exceed **$2 per month**.
    
* **Email recipients** : Specify the email recipients you want to notify when the threshold has exceeded. I'm giving mine.

    ### **Step 8: Monitor Your Budget**
